# variableScope
What is scope? Your explanation should include the idea of global vs. block scope.
A scope is a set of rules that determines the use of different variables. There are two types of scopes, global, and block scopes.
The difference between the two is that when you set a variable in the global scope it's going to be avaialable everywhere in your entire code.
A block scope won't be everywhere in the code however only within the function block you create.

Why are global variables avoided?
They are more likely to make a side effect in a program.

Explain JavaScript's strict mode
JavaScript's strict mode prevent certain things from happeneing that may cause a error. It's more like a filter for javascript from my aspect that helps you prevent errors.

What are side effects, and what is a pure function?
Side effects are when a function reaches the parent scope and alters certain things. A pure function consist of it being determinate and has no side effects.
